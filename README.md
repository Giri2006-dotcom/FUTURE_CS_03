# FUTURE_CS_03
Cyber Security Internship – Task 3: API Security Risk Analysis. Covers testing of public APIs using Postman/Insomnia, identification of insecure endpoints, authentication/authorization issues, and missing rate-limiting. Deliverable: professional API security risk analysis report documented in GitHub.

# API Security Risk Analysis – JSONPlaceholder

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Postman** – for sending HTTP requests and analyzing API responses  
- **GitHub** – for documentation and sharing the project  

## 🌐 Web API Examined
- **JSONPlaceholder** → https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com  
  - Endpoints tested:
    - `GET /posts`
    - `GET /users`
    - `GET /comments`
    - `POST /posts`

## 📘 Purpose
This project demonstrates common API security risks such as:
- Open or unauthenticated endpoints  
- Excessive data exposure in responses  
- Weak or missing authentication  
- Authorization issues  
- Missing rate limiting  
- Input validation problems  

The analysis is performed for learning purposes only, without exploiting the API.
